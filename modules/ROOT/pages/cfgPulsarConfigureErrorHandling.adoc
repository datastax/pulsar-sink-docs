= Configure error handling

Use the DataStax Apache Pulsar(TM) Connector's `ignoreErrors` parameter to specify how the connector handles runtime errors when processing messages from Pulsar topics and writing them to database tables.

You can configure the connector to ignore specific types of errors or all errors, depending on the option you choose:

`NONE` (default)::
No errors are ignored.
+
Any error causes processing to stop.

`DRIVER`::
Only driver errors are ignored.
+
If a driver error occurs, the connector continues processing records.
Other errors cause processing to stop.
+
Logging of non-blocking driver errors depends on the driver configuration.

`ALL`::
All errors are ignored.
+
The connector continues processing records even if an error occurred on the prior record.
The erroneous record is logged once, and then the next record is picked up by the Pulsar Connector automatically.

`false` (deprecated)::
Use `NONE`.

`true` (deprecated)::
Use `DRIVER`.
