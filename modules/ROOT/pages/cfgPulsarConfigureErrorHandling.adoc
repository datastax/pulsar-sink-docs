= Configure error handling

With {product}, use the `ignoreErrors` parameter to specify how the {product-short} handles runtime errors when processing messages from {pulsar-short} topics and writing them to database tables.

You can configure the {product-short} to ignore specific types of errors or all errors, depending on the option you choose:

`NONE` (default)::
No errors are ignored.
+
Any error causes processing to stop.

`DRIVER`::
Only driver errors are ignored.
+
If a driver error occurs, the {product-short} continues processing records.
Other errors cause processing to stop.
+
Logging of non-blocking driver errors depends on the driver configuration.

`ALL`::
All errors are ignored.
+
The {product-short} continues processing records even if an error occurred on the prior record.
The erroneous record is logged once, and then the next record is picked up by the {pulsar-short} connector automatically.

`false` (deprecated)::
Use `NONE`.

`true` (deprecated)::
Use `DRIVER`.
