= Determine topic data structure

You can use `https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/reference-cli-tools/#consume[pulsar-client]` to examine the structure of {pulsar-short} messages for a topic.

This can help you determine your field-to-column mapping.

To show {pulsar-short} messages:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
bin/pulsar-client consume **TOPIC_NAME** -s "**SUBSCRIPTION_NAME**"
----

Replace the following:

* `**TOPIC_NAME**`: Name of the {pulsar-short} topic receiving the messages.
* `**SUBSCRIPTION_NAME**`: Arbitrary name for the consumer subscription.

The response is the message data when a message is received.
For example, the following response indicates a message with a key of `My key` and content of `My content`:

[source,console]
----
----- got message -----
key:[My key], properties:[], content:My content
----
