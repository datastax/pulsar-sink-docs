= The now() function in mappings 
:page-aliases: cfgPulsarNowFunction.adoc
:page-tag: pulsar-connector,dev,develop,pulsar

In the Apache Pulsarâ„¢ topic mapping, you can use the ``now()``function.
It returns `TIMEUUID`, which is documented in the link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/6.8/cql/cql/cql_using/refTimeUuidFunctions.html[UUID and timeuuid column].

For example:

[source,language-yaml]
----
topic:
  my_topic:
    my_ks:
      my_table:
        mapping: 'col1=now()''
----

In this example, you must create `col1` in a CQL table with the following definition:

[source,no-highlight]
----
col1 timeuuid
----

You can use the `now()` function for mapping of multiple database columns:

[source,language-yaml]
----
topic:
  my_topic:
    my_ks:
      my_table:
        mapping: 'col1=now(), col2=now(), col3=now()''
----

In the example above, each occurrence of `now()` is evaluated and return a different `TIMEUUID`.

== Behavior of now() with DELETE records

When the value of a record arrives to DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector instance, it could be a `DELETE`, assuming `deletesEnabled` is `true`; see xref:configure-reference-pulsar-dse-table.adoc#deletesEnabled[deletesEnabled].

For example, consider a case where a user has mapping and used the `now()` function:

[source,no-highlight]
----
my_pk=value.my_pk, my_value=value.my_value, loaded_at=now()
----

If there is an insertion of a value that is `null`, such as:

[source,no-highlight]
----
"{\"my_pk\": 1234567, \"my_value\": null}";
----

In this scenario, the called `now()` function is ignored, and the record is deleted.
