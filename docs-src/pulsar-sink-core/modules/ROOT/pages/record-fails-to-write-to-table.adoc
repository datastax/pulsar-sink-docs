= Record fails to write 
:page-aliases: trbPulsarTsRecordFailsToWriteToTable.adoc
:page-tag: pulsar-connector,dev,develop,admin,manage,pulsar

Records never appear in the DataStax Enterprise (DSE) database table. The cause can be issues with node availability, transient errors that prevent writes due to consistency level, a schema change where a mapped column was removed from the target table, and so forth.

== Remediation

. Change the DataStax Apache Pulsarâ„¢ Connector  `verbose` option to `true` in your sink configuration file:
+
[source,language-yaml]
----
configs:
  verbose: true
----

. Reload the sink configuration file:
+
[source,language-yaml]
----
bin/pulsar-admin sinks update --name cass-sink-kv --sinkConfigFile conf/qs.yml
"Updated successfully" 
----

. Check for `WARN` and `ERROR` entries in the output log.
